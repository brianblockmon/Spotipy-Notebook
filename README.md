# Spotipy-Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook from my Spotify Data Project

This notebook contains the code used to connect to the Spotify API, collect playlist data, and analyze that data. 

The purpose of this project was to analyze the changes in music over the past decade. Through the project, I came to the conclusion that song duration,
energy, and danceability represented the most significant changes over the past decade. 

I wrote a Medium article that goes into more detail about the project.
